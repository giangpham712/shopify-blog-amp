If you’re looking for super plump, soft lips to beckon the object of your desire, you’ll need a few tricks up your sleeve.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">To create a truly memorable pout, it is critical to first adopt a lip skin care routine. We’ll also show you how to plump up lips using natural makeup pigments – and get it done in under 5 minutes flat.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Want to know our best-kept beauty secrets for that perfect pout? Keep reading to find out our 7 easy steps for full, luscious lips!</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"m-v text-center h3\"><b>Step 1: Exfoliate Regularly</b></div>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Before all else, adopt a rigorous lip exfoliating routine. The skin doesn’t turn over like the rest of our skin, so it needs a bit of assistance in shedding its rough layers.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">We start all our lip routines with a mandatory lip scrub, which can buff away dullness and flakes. Use a moisturizing lip scrub, ideally made with ingredients like coconut oil and olive oil. Check out our recipe for <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/blogs/feed/how-to-use-and-make-your-own-lip-scrub\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3 DIY lip scrubs</a> that taste as good as they scrub!</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">How often should you exfoliate your lips? If your lips are prone to rough patches, exfoliate twice per week. For routine maintenance, once a week should be sufficient.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"m-v text-center h3\"><b>Step 2: Apply Lip Skin Care</b></div>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Did you know that the skin on your lips is different from the skin on your face and body? Your lips have a thin – rather than thick – stratum corneum, the protective outer layer of skin that guards against the elements. The lips also lack sebaceous glands, the source of moisturizing lipid called sebum: skin’s naturally lubricating oil.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Since the physiology of the lips is far less capable of protecting and moisturizing itself, this is why we swear by a twice daily (or more) lip balm application. Lips won’t look plump and healthy when they’re dry or flakey; regular use of <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/collections/lip-balm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">natural, luxurious lip balm</a> will keep lips looking supple and soft – trademarks of full lips.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Keep lips healthy and free of imperfections with our herbal <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/products/lysine-herbs-healing-lip-balm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lysine + Herbs Lip Balm</a>. This healing formula mitigates and prevents unsightly cold sores from forming, thereby ensuring that the focus can be directed to the utter lusciousness of your lips – not your cold sore.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"m-v text-center h3\"><b>Step 3: Prep Your Canvas</b></div>\n<p class=\"m-v\">If you’re relying on color to enhance lips, be sure to prep skin first with a flesh-toned foundation or concealer. This step completely neutralizes the tone of your lips, and intensifies any following lip color.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Our <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/products/fruit-pigmented-long-last-concealer-with-super-fruits\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fruit Pigmented® Long Last Concealer</a> allows you to essentially cover the outline of lips entirely, to then build the shape of fuller lips with your lip color. If you plan on using matte lipstick, finish by setting the lips with <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/products/bamboo-blur-powder\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bamboo Blur Powder</a> for a silky smooth finish.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"m-v text-center h3\"><b>Step 4: Highlight Away</b></div>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Highlighter isn’t just for the cheeks and nose; it can also be used to bring volume to the lip area. The cupid’s bow is the area between the nose and mouth – those two, perky ridges that lead right down to the apex of our lips. A light sweep of a <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/collections/natural-bronzer-highlighters/products/fruit-pigmented-pink-champagne-luminescent-powder\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">natural highlighter</a> or lip contour with a delicate fan brush can go a long way in making lips look naturally pouty and luscious.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\"><em><b>PRO TIP:</b> To highlight lips, dab a bit of powder highlighter to your bottom lip, right at the center. Purse lips together once, then twice to blend. Highlight will give the illusion of plumper lips when it catches the light!</em></p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"m-v text-center h3\"><b>Step 5: Try Lip Liner</b></div>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Lip liner allows us to expand our lip line, instead of applying lip product ‘inside the box’. Use a shade that’s 1-2 shades darker than the lip product you are planning to apply. Go above your natural lip line just slightly, being sure to stick to your true lip line when it comes to the outer points of the lips. Buff with a <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/collections/tools/products/cruelty-free-smudger-brush-e20\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">small brush</a> to bring color inward, and diffuse your lip’s outline for a soft, bee-stung finish.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Alternatively, to get crisp, luscious lips like Rihanna, create definition with your lip pencil. Starting on the innermost rim of your mouth, draw upward on your top lip and downward on your bottom lip. Lines should be in the center for the lower lip, and outward in both directions on the top lip, but feel free to play around with this and see what works best for you.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"m-v text-center h3\"><b>Step 6: Go for Nude, Mauve, or Pink Lipstick</b></div>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Choosing the right color is key to the illusion of plump, full lips. Dark colors will actually make lips smaller, especially if your lips are naturally thin. Using shades like nude, pink, or mauve will actually enhance the size and shape of your lips. Give <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/products/fruit-pigmented-cocoa-butter-matte-lipstick?variant=3332466114584\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cassia</a> or <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/collections/lipstick/products/fruit-pigmented-cocoa-butter-matte-lipstick?variant=3332466245656\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cacti</a> matte lipsticks a whirl, or experiment with <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/products/fruit-pigmented-pomegranate-oil-anti-aging-lipstick?variant=3427446554648\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buttercup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/products/fruit-pigmented-pomegranate-oil-anti-aging-lipstick?variant=3427446652952\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thistle</a> semi-gloss shades for the perfect pout.</p>\n<br> <img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0648/1955/files/KimGlossLips_4cc0cfb9-a4ca-4760-b8dc-744bacdb7333.jpg?v=1576257590\" alt=\"Kim Gloss Lips\" class=\"m-v\">\n<div class=\"m-v text-center h3\"><b>Step 7: Get Glossy</b></div>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Nothing says “plump” quite like a glossy pout. Our <a href=\"https://www.100percentpure.com/products/fruit-pigmented-lip-gloss\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"thick-u-l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fruit Pigmented® Lip Gloss</a> is juicy, moisturizing, and enhances the natural color of our lips. These semi-sheer and sheer shades glisten with just the right level of shine, without being greasy or sticky.</p>\n<p class=\"m-v\">Dab a juicy, moisturizing lip gloss on lips as a finishing touch to your lip look. If you don’t like an all-over gloss finish, just dab the gloss at the center of your lips to give the illusion of light hitting the fullest, most prominent area of your lips.</p>\n<br>\n<p class=\"m-b\">See – piece of cake, right? These steps for full lips are written in detail, but take less than 5 minutes when done all together. With most products that promise to enhance lips, there are skin irritants inside or ingredients that we can’t even pronounce. With this routine, you are using healthy, natural ingredients that leave your lips looking and feeling better than what you started with.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</section>",
